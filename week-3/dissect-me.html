1. What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I used a variety of html5 tags - <section>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <nav>.
Since html is new to me, I am fortunate to be learning these tags in my first exposure, rather than getting comfortable with an older set of tags and then have to larn a new set.


2. How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The browser lays out elements from left to right in a hierarchical fashion. The leftmost tag is <html>. Everything else should be to the right (except for the closing </html>). For example, the <header>, <section>, and <footer> elements are at equal levels of prominence in this hierarchy.

From what I can see in google dev tools, it looks to me as if the <header>, <section>, and <footer> divide the page into three parts, then the content within those parts is laid out and adjustments to percentage of page occupied are made to accomodate the content.

3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned that I need to dig deeper into sublime to utilize it's full power. The snippet for a basic html file made me happy. I imagine that I will be creating more snippets in the near future.

      In the first week of Dev Bootcamp, we were introduced to using the command line interface for communicating with our computers.We were also introduced to version control using git and hosting our projects on GitHub. I want to explain what I learned this week.

    <h4> Why learn the command line interface?</h4>

    <p>
        If you have never used a computer before the 1990s, then the command line interface (cli) will appear to be an anachronism. Most computers come with a GUI (graphical user interface) that gives you a nice visualization of your file/directory structure. If you want to move a file from one directory to another, you usually just drag and drop. Similarly, if you want to rename a file, you just right-click and type in a new name. Why would you want to type in 'mv new-directoy/ file-name'? The answer is that you can accomplish this with one line of text, whereas for dragging and dropping, you have to (i) right click on the file and hold it while (ii) dragging it to the new folder (and hope you don't release the right mouse button) until (iii) you reach the destination folder (which may be off-screen) when you may release the right mouse button. Compare typing one line of text, with three mouse-actions. If you are a casual user of your computer, then it probably doesn't matter. Do what's more convenient. However, if you are a developer or a data scientist who has to deal with many (hundreds of) files, then using your mouse to manipulate each file is not feasible. This is where the cli becomes your new best friend. You can use the cli to write scripts that will automate tasks such as the ones described. A few other advantages of the cli over GUIs include: searching through files using regular expressions (as opposed to having to open and inspect files), redirecting output of programs into files (as opposed to only seeing out on your screen), and not having to learn a new cli when switching computers or operating systems (whereas each new version of an operating system may come with a new GUI that initially takes some getting used to). There are other advantages, but I am still new to this environment so I have not learned enough to appreciate them yet.
