2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal is to present myself to potential employers as a skilled developer.
I'll have pages devoted to my work history  and projects that I've completed while attending DBC.

3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience's interests are in potential employees. My site will demonstrate my capabilities through links to any projects I complete. In addition, my site will demonstrate an awareness of web design principles and UX issues.

4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I want visitors to look at my projects and to look at my work history. Each page would have my contact information for convenince.

5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Design drives development. Developers and designers are on the same team, so understanding design will make you a better collaborator with the designers. Designers solve problems (at a high level, through their designs). Developers familiar with design principles will be in a much better position to create solutions to the problems posed by designers.

User experience addresses isses of how to improve human-computer interaction - e.g. enhancing accessibility, efficiency, and giving a pleasant experience that will make the user want to reuse the software (or revisit the web site).

6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience encompasses several branches of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Some things considered are ergonomics, ease of use, accesibility, and efficiency. These are determining factors in whether someone wants to use your software or visit your website.

7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Nothing was really tedious, but questions 5 and 6 seemed to have a large overlap.
