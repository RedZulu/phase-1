- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It's pretty cool. I certainly won't forget how to create a link.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

It was interesting. I've never thought about html abstractly. For example, I've never thought of italics, bold, or underline as special cases of the <em> tag. I've never considered the issue of how and which tags giving content meaning.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I focused only on getting the content on the page - nothing else.
I treated this challenge as a first draft and only felt obligated to get content and links on the page.
Formatting comes after completing the first draft.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

What's good about html is that it is a universal markup language. It works for any browser. You don't need to learn different versions for Chrome or Firefox (and who cares about IE?).

What's bad about html is that it can turn chicken shit into chicken salad.
An aesthetically pleasing website can convince you of the validity of its content, whereas an unappealing website (no mater how valid it's content) wouldn't get a second glance. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

Most tags come in open/closing pairs. It's easier to remember the ones that don't.
Also, when writing html, start from the outside (i.e <DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, <bod> tags) to the inside (i.e. <div>, <p>, <ol>, <ul>, <href> tags).

Anything else you can look up.
