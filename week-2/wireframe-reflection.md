I revised my wireframe, especially after browsing through  [I â™¥ wirefames](http://wireframes.tumblr.com/).

### What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I asked myself "Am I trying to squeeze too much into a single page?", "How can I reduce my pages to the minimum number of components." I wikied "simple wireframes' for ideas. Another thing I did was to examine my favorite websites under Wirify. I discovered that I look at a lot of busy/ugly websites.

Nothing was tedious. I work under the assumption that these questions are designed to get us to think deeply about these topics, so I don't find these questions tedious, but I do find trying to answer them exhausting.
