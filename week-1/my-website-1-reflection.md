* Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository, go to your profile page on GitHub. Lokk in the upper-righthand corner. Next to your mini-avatar it s "+" sign. Click on this and a drop-down menu should offer the option of creating a "New repository". Click on this.
Give your repository a memorable name. Choose "Public" visibility, and add an MIT license. One you've done this, click the "Create repository" button. You have created a repo(sitory).

To clone the repository to your computer, open your git-bash window (the command line interface window) and navigate to the directory where you wish to clone your repo. Go to the repo page you just created and look to the lower right side.
You should see a box labeled HTTPS clone URL. Either copy the URL directly or click on the clipboard symbol. Go bback to the command line window and type 'git clone "paste the URL you copied here" '. Hit ENTER and you're' done (you maybe asked to type in your GitHub login information).

* Describe what open source means.

Open source is the practice of sharing the code behind the software. The software that you pay for comes in the form of an executible file that you install on your computer. This file then iinstalls the software and you can use it. However, you are not given the actual program code. You cannot see how the software works. You cannot modify the code to either twea or customize the software. Under open source, you are given the code and you are free to modify or enhance it as you see fit.

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

In principle, I love the idea of Open Source. I like the thought of smart, creative people being able to customize and improve the products of other smart and creative people for eveyone's benefit. I am grateful that Open Source software exists, otherwise I would have to buy expensive products that don't do what I need (e.g. try typsetting mathematics in Word).

The notion also makes me feel a little protective/territorial. I would probably be a bit resentful of any large businesses using my hardwork for free. In that sense, Open Source does not feel like Utopia - but only because the real world is not Utopia. 

* Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses ease some of the qualms raised by the previous question. I think it's important to get credit for your work. I like the idea of any software products derived/spawned from an Open Source software have to carry the license indicating the nature of this product.

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Nothing was really solidified in this challenge. I'm still struggling with the whole GitHub work flow. However, I feel less daunted now then I did during challenge 1.5. I just need to get a lot of repetition on this material.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The following book Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub is available online  https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

I haven't had the time to dip into it yet, but it looks like a good resource.
