## 1.1 Think About Time Reflection 

In this assignment, I tried to think of what prevents me from being productive and how can I apply the techniques listed to overcome these hurdles. One hurdle is that I am easily distracted by "small" noises - e.g. finger drumming, eating sounds, pen clicking (aka misophonia). A second hurdle, is the fear of not completing a challenge.

I looked at all of the techniques listed. I've never meditated and look forward to an opportunity to try it. Guided and moving meditation sounds promising to me. I don't think I could handle sensory meditation with its focus on sensory stimuli. One idea mentioned in the counter-intuitive productivity article - #3: Try to Get Almost Nothing Done - makes a great deal of sense to me. Rather than panicking about not completing a challenge in one fell swoop, try to accumulate a lot of tiny successes.

Time Boxing is the use of a fixed period of time (e.g. 30 minutes - 25 of which are used for focused work and the other 5 for a break) for work or study. This is how I've tried to manage my work/study time for most of my life. It certainly works.

My Time Management plan for Phase 0 is:

* On a weekly basis, start early - read any assignments and challenges as soon as they are posted. I learn by repetition and starting over.

* The sooner I start, the more opportunities I'll have to do this

* On a daily basis, start my work day early and get a good night's sleep.

*If at all possible, have one free evening each week where I don't do any work.
