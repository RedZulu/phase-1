## 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

In this assignment, I tried to think of what prevents me from being productive and how can I apply the techniques listed to overcome these hurdles. One hurdle is that I am easily distracted by "small" noises - e.g. finger drumming, eating sounds, pen clicking (aka misophonia). A second hurdle, is the fear of not completing a challenge.

I looked at all of the techniques listed. I've never meditated and look forward to an opportunity to try it. Guided and moving meditation sounds promising to me. I don't think I could handle sensory meditation with its focus on sensory stimuli. One idea mentioned in the counter-intuitive productivity article - #3: Try to Get Almost Nothing Done - makes a great deal of sense to me. Rather than panicking about not completing a challenge in one fell swoop, try to accumulate a lot of tiny successes.

Time Boxing is the use of a fixed period of time (e.g. 30 minutes - 25 of which are used for focused work and the other 5 for a break) for work or study. This is how I've tried to manage my work/study time for most of my life. It certainly works.

My Time Management plan for Phase 0 is:

* On a weekly basis, start early - read any assignments and challenges as soon as they are posted. I learn by repetition and starting over. The sooner I start, the more opportunities I'll have to do this

*On a daily basis, start my work day early and get a good night's sleep.

*If at all possible, have one free evening each week where I don't do any work.



## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

*What is a shell? What is "bash?"

A shell is a command line interface. Before there were graphical user interfaces (and mice/touchpads), the medium for giving commands to a computer was a keyboard. The shell is the interface - we type commands into the shell and the shell translates those commands into machine language.

Bash is the current shell for Unix and (I'm going to guess) Linux.

*What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

The biggest challenge was to not cheat and create/manipulate files by pointing and clicking.  I am a lousy touch typist. This challenge has convinced me of the importance of learning how to touch type. This material feels like playing scales when trying to learn a musical instrument -  not a lot of fun (at first), rewarding if done regularly.

*Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

I was able to use most of the commands (although I've been mixing up Unix and Windows commands). Pushd and popd were the ones giving me the most trouble.

*In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

Since the command line is new to me, I would say that ls, cd, and ../ are the most important for me. With these, I can at least find my way around the file system. Once I know my way around, then I can focus on creating/removing directories and files.

*Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd  This tells you where you currently are in the file system

-ls   This lists the contents (files and directories) of the directory that you are currently in.

-mv   This allows you rename a file.

-cd   This allows you to move to a directory contained in the directory you are currently located in.

-../  This allows you to move in the opposite direction - i.e. up to the directory that contains the directory your are currently located in.

-touch   This allows you to create empty files.

-mkdir   This allows you to create directories.

-less    This displays the contents of a file one screenful at a time.

-rmdir   This allows you to delete an empty directory.

-rm      This allows you to delete a file.

-help    This lets you find information on commands.
